> AI-powered workout tracking app for serious lifters. Generates personalized workouts from your training history, analyzes lifting form from video, and supports group training.

## About

Bench Only is a free fitness app at https://benchpressonly.com that uses AI to help lifters train smarter. It tracks workouts, generates personalized training programs, and analyzes exercise form from video — all powered by AI that learns from your actual training data.

## Features

### AI Workout Generation
The AI reviews your complete training history — lift PRs, estimated 1RM data, RPE trends, and pain flags — to generate workouts tailored to you. It calculates working weights from your maxes, skips exercises flagged for pain, includes warm-up ramps, and progressively overloads based on real performance data. Supports bodyweight-only and hotel/travel modes.

### AI Form Check
Upload a video of any lift and get instant frame-by-frame form analysis. The system uses client-side motion detection to identify the active portion of the video, extracts key frames on-device (video never leaves the phone), and sends compressed frames to GPT-4o vision for analysis. Returns per-frame scores with phase detection (setup, descent, bottom, ascent, lockout), specific coaching cues, and prioritized recommendations.

### Group Training
Create training groups, invite athletes, and assign AI-generated workouts to the team. The AI personalizes weights for each athlete based on their individual training history. Coaches can track completion and progress across the group.

### 1RM Testing and Tracking
Built-in 1RM test protocols with warm-up ramp calculations. Tracks estimated one-rep maxes over time across all exercises. Includes a standalone 1RM calculator tool.

### AI Coach Chat
Ask training questions and get answers informed by your workout history, goals, and progress data.

### Goal Tracking
Set strength, consistency, and body composition goals with automated progress tracking and milestone celebrations.

### Cardio Tracking
Log cardio sessions alongside strength training with duration, distance, and heart rate tracking.

## Pricing
